# Frontend Mentor - NFT card component solution

## Overview

Hello!  
This is my second project from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).  
This one was a bit different than the first one but idea was the same. The biggest issue I had was with the horizontal line between NFT description section and creator info section.  
Spacing and centering images with text was also a bit of a trouble for me.
